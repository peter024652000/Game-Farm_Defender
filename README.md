Hi everyone,

Finally I finished my second game and I am glad to share this to you all. 

As the first game is finished, I quickly moved towards the next Unity coding course and started my second game. It took me 60 days to complete the game. In the  first two weeks, I learned new video game coding skills from the course and produced the asset with pixel art tool - Aseprite by myself in the following two weeks. Oh! I even tried to work on the animation as well at the same time. In the beginnning of the second month, I finished the basic game machanics as the course taught and tried to enrich and polish the game to become special.

I added the progressive levels instead of looping waves. The player needs to defeat the correct numbers and types of the enemy to move on next level, this game is not just adding the score after defeating enemies anymore. Also, each enemy has its own experessive looking and moving pattern. Try to observe their movements to avoid their attaack and defeat them!

Besides, I put lots of effort in terms of UI, SFX and VFX. As the life indicator and enemy indicator are at the bottom of the screen, It won't bother the view of enemies' movements during the gameplay and the player can easily know how many lives and how many enemies are left by a glimpse. For VFX and SFX such as explosion effect, hitting sound and character blinking, it provides the feedback to the player to know if they did the attack correctly and was hit by the enemy.

Not like the previous game, it shoud be no bug this time as I have fixed every bugs I faced during the testing. 
However, it is still happy to hear any feedbacks and comments from you after playing this game. 

Hope you all enjoy this game and see you when my thrid game is finished:)
